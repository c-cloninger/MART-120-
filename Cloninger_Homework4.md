<h1> Carrie Cloninger Week 4 Homework </h1>

<h2> Past and Present Influencers </h2>

<p> I have fallen down often, especially in the last five years. If you were to look at my collegiate transcripts, you'd see more failed classes than passed and encounter many confused professors. Confused, because I am smart. Capable. And, more than likely, put in several weeks of excellent work before falling off the map. (Don't worry, that's not going to happen here.) Despite my scholastic failings, Tom Stergios, the President of ATG's Missoula Solutions Center, continued to offer me a position at his company. And, finally, I accepted.

I met Tom when I was a freshman in high school. His twins were five years old at the time, and he and his wife, Mary Lou, needed a consistent babysitter. I worked for them throughout high school. Back then, he was heading the Missoula "branch" of ATG from his home office. Often, I watched the twins so he could work uninterrupted.

Later, I got to know Tom as an adult after I started bartending at Red's Bar. He slowly introduced me to his employees and I watched his company grow through Tom's continued grit and optimism. Around this time, he would ask me: "Carrie, when are you going to come work for me?" and "Don't you think it is time to stop tending bar?" I didn't feel qualified to come work for Tom. I felt like a fraud. Like I'd done nothing to deserve a position at a company he'd worked so hard to build--especially because I'd had a first hand view of just how far he'd come with ATG.

And then. ATG was bought by Cognizant. The AIM Program was introduced in an effort to ramp up employees in a fraction of the usual time. Tom came into Red's while I was working, as soon as the training program was announced, and signed me up for it on his phone. I was hired for the inaugural training class ten days later.

I owe Tom Stergios a lot. But most of all, for giving me a chance at a career without first having done the legwork of a degree. </p>

I am struggling with my app. It works...kind of. I'm continuing to work on it in an attempt to pull values from my dropdown menu and have them drive the functionality of the app.
