<h1> Carrie Cloninger Week 2 Homework</h1>

<h2> Synopsis of Last Lecture </h2>
  <p>
    Randy Pausch's humility affected me most strongly through his hour long lecture. He stood there as man, renowned in his field and coping with terminal illness, and he was humble. Time and again, throughout his talk, he told stories of people who affected real change upon his life. Sometimes these people were famous intellectuals, and sometimes they were students in his undergraduate class. Pausch held no regard for status or esteem, he simply took in the people on his path and learned from them. He quoted Jon Snoddy in his lecture as saying: "If you give people enough time, they will surprise and impress you."  Randy Pausch lived those words. And he kindled a small grain of motivation within me to do the same. </p>
  <p>  The Last Lecture was chock full of life lessons and not-so-small truths. I could relate to almost every other word out of Randy Pausch's mouth. The concept that struck me the most, however,  was his metaphor of the brick wall. He noted that brick walls are there to stop the people who don't want "it" badly enough. They exist to weed out the undetermined and stonewall the wavering. But--the brick wall is surmountable, you just have to want it.</p>

<h2> Synopsis of Mindset </h2>
  <ol>
    <li> Results from Mindset Quiz = Growth Mindset</li>
    <li> Mindset Perspective: I have an altered perception of what mindset is after this week's readings. I've always considered achieving the right mindset akin to reaching Nirvana (or something equally as difficult). But it is as simple as determination and hard work--two things that are completely within my control and absolutely doable.</li>
    <li> Future Outlook: It will affect my outlook moving forward. I now possess the tools to check myself should I begin to slide back into a "Fixed Mindset."
